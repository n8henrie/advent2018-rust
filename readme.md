# advent2018-rust

This is my repo for my work on [Advent of Code (2018)][0] in [Rust][1]. I've
been interested in learning Rust for a while, and after reading [TRPL][2], I
thought it would be a fun way to learn the basics.

It looks like it took me 483 days to get through what is supposed to be a 25
day challenge. Even taking into account full time (non-tech) work and 2 young
kids, that's a pretty long time, but I'm excited to have made it through, and I
learned a lot along the way.

After finishing, I went ahead and compiled everything into a [workspace][3] so
that it can all be build at once, and I used [hyperfine][4] to benchmark the
code from each day (except day 11, which still takes around 2 minutes, so I
just used a rough timing estimate there). 

Along the way, I got a lot of help from [r/rust][5] and [r/learnrust][6] on
Reddit -- many thanks to the many beginner-friendly redditors in the Rust
community!
